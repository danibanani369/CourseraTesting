			<h1>Types of Steam Trains</h1>
			<p>Steam trains often share several common elements. All steam trains are powered by boilers, which boil water inside of cylinders to produce steam, which creates pressure that powers the train. Additionally, all steam trains have at least one set of lead wheels, which are non-powered wheels found at the front of the train to handle curves, at least one set of driving wheels, which are found directly under the boiler and provide the power to move the train, and at least one set of trailing wheels, which are found near the end of the train cab and offer support for the rest of the train.</p>
			<p>There are three main types of steam trains:</p>

				<h2><span class="sectionheads">Non-Articulated</span></h2>
				<p>Also known as &apos;straight locomotives&apos;, non-articulated steam trains only have one set of driving wheels and are generally the slowest trains. They also have difficulty navigating sharp curves, particularly on winding mountain passes with steep gradients.</p>

			<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12 sections">
				<h2><span class="sectionheads">Duplex</span></h2>
				<p>Duplex steam locomotives are also called duplex-drive trains, and they are not articulated. However, they have two sets of cylinders and drive wheels, which was intended to provide more stability than a typical non-articulated train, but often suffered from hammer blow/overbalance.</p>

				<h2><span class="sectionheads">Articulated</span></h2>
				<p>Articulated steam locomotives have two or more sets of driving wheels powered by a single boiler. The axels of these driving wheel sets do not have to remain parallel to one another, allowing the train to swivel around curves much easier than non-articulated trains.</p>
